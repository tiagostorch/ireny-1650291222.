The project was developed with android studio, in Kotlin language

It was implemented using the MVVM architecture taking advantage of the architecture components recommended by google: Fragment + ViewModel

To control navigation between screens, NavHostFragment was used

For local data storage Android roomdatabase and DataStore were used

To authenticate users, firebase authentication features were used, integrated with facebook and google

To manage the asynchronous flows, Android Corroutines, Flow and LiveData were used.

Koin was used for the injection of stems.

And to generate the MPAndroidChart charts (so far no chart that needs the library has been implemented)
